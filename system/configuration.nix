  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,
  # so changing it will NOT upgrade your system.

  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
  # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.

  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
